Automatic streetlight controller

Switching of street lights from time to time manually becomes tedious when it is required 365 days without any break. Since we have easily available electronic components, we can build a simple and a very cheap circuit that can do the work hassle free.
Since the circuit has a feedback of the ambient lighting, i.e turns ON the street light when it’s about to dusk and turn OFF when its about to dawn, by this way we can save electricity, avoid unwanted lighting, and switch it exactly when it’s required.
